# Music Genre Classification (GTZAN)

This project explores music genre classification using audio features
extracted from the GTZAN dataset. We investigate segment-level and song-level
classification performance using classical machine learning models.

## Pipeline
- Feature extraction from 3-second audio segments
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split with leakage prevention
- Model training and evaluation
